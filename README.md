•	Developed a computer vision project to create a real-life version of Harry Potter's invisible cloak.

•	Utilizes advanced image processing techniques to simulate the effect of invisibility.

•	The project employs background subtraction methods to detect and separate the user from the background.

•	By identifying and removing the user's silhouette from the video feed, the illusion of invisibility is created.

•	The result is displayed in real-time, making it appear as though the user is wearing an invisible cloak.

•	Demonstrates the power of computer vision in creating magical and visually appealing effects inspired by popular culture.

•	Offers an engaging and interactive experience, allowing users to have fun and imagine themselves as wizards like Harry Potter.
